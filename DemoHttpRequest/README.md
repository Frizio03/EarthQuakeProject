# Getting data from REST APIs

### Definitions

An *API* (Application Programming Interface) is a mechanism that allows communication between two software components using definitions and protocols.

A *REST API* is a data elaboration interface between a web server and a web client. The API receives **requests** and provides **responses** with information and data.

The *HTTP PROTOCOL* is a communication protocol that uses GET, POST, DELETE methods.

### Application for HTTP request

* **Web Browser**: each web browser can make HTTP requests with GET method;
* **Postman**: an application to set requests and view response data

## HTTP URL

An URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a char sequence that uniquely identifies an online resource address. An URL is composed by the following elements:

* **SCHEME**: that identifies wich protocol use to reach resources;
* **HOST**: the name of website domain or subdomain
* **PATH**: the path to reach interested resources
* **QUERY STRING**: contains input data (for example for the API) using key-value couples. It starts with the `?` char.

## Make an HTTP request with JAVA

We can create an example java class in order to make an HTTP request and read the response data:

```java
public class RequestExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //Here we will place the HTTP request
    }
}
```
### Dependency

To make an HTTP request we can use the **okHttp client** importing the following dependency into `pom.xml` file.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.squareup.okhttp3</groupId>
    <artifactId>okhttp</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.0-alpha.12</version>
</dependency>
```
The okHttp client is class that allows to build requests and HTTP calls with built-in classes.
First of all we have to create a new instace of okHttp client:

```java
//Creating a new OkHttpClient class to make requests
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();
```

### Building URL

Now, in order to make a request to the API we have to create the URL.

Note well, you can also use an URL string, however when you have to make a lot of different requests to the same API with variable query string parameters the `HttpUrl.Builder()` helps you a lot!

```java
//URL data
String protocol = "https";
String host = "jsonplaceholder.typicode.com";
String path = "posts";

//Building URL
HttpUrl.Builder urlBuilder = new HttpUrl.Builder();

        urlBuilder.scheme(protocol);
        urlBuilder.host(host);
        urlBuilder.addPathSegment(path);

URL myurl = urlBuilder.build().url();
```
The result is:
```url
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
```

You can also add query string params befor building the url using the `addQueryParameter(String name, String value)` method. Here is an example:

```java
radius = 500;
builder.addQueryParameter("maxradiuskm", String.valueOf(radius);
```

### Building the request

As you know a REST request is composed by some different parts like METHOD, HEADER, BODY...

The okHttpClient helps you to build the request:

```java
//Setting the request parameters (defaults to GET method)
Request request = new Request.Builder()
        .url(myurl)
        .build();
```

### Executing the call

When a software tries to execute a call it could have a positive or negative outcome. In order to stop the program when a call produces a negative result we can use a `try-catch` structure:

```java
//Generating a new call to obtain the response
Call call = client.newCall(request);

//Trying to execute the call
try(Response response = call.execute()){
    //Some action if call result is ok...
}
catch(IOException e){
    //Catching errors and throwing runtime exceptions
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
}
```
## Access to response information

### Parsing body

A *JSON* (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format for information exchange. Using simple word JSON is a string with a special format composed by elements of key-value pairs.

The `JsonNode` class is a class that stores information as ke-value pairs. The Jackson dependency provides some helpful tools that parse a JSON string to a `JsonNode` object.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.16.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The Jackson `ObjectMapper` class can parse a JSON string to a `JsonNode` object using the `readTree()` method.

```java
//Saving body data before OkHttpClient closes the request
ResponseBody responseBody = response.body();

//Creating a new ObjcetMapper from JACKSON library
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();

//Parsing the body string to JsonNode format (from JACKSON)
JsonNode bodyNode = mapper.readTree(responseBody.string());

//Printing some information from Json
System.out.println("------- Printing first post infos -------");
System.out.println(bodyNode.get(0).get("id").asInt());
System.out.println(bodyNode.get(0).get("title").asText());
System.out.println(bodyNode.get(0).get("body").asText());
```

As you see now you can access to alla JSON information using key values and `get()` method.

### Parsing Json to class

Often Json data have to be used as class field values. The `ObjectMapper` `readValue()` method helps you to put Json values into corresponding class fields.

The method takes a String in Json format and a class type. The method returns an object that is an instance of the provided class with fields filled using Json values.

```java
JsonNode jsonbody = mapper.readTree(responseBody.string());
Post pst = mapper.readValue(jsonbody.toString(), Post.class);
pst.getId() //Will print the name contained into jsonbody "id" field.
```
